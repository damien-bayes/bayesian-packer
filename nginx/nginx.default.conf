# BLOCK DIRECTIVES
##################

# NOTE: There are 2 server blocks and both of them are listening on port 80 using the listen directive.

# Configure a virtual host (packer.bayesianflow.space)
server {
  listen 10033;
  server_name packer.bayesianflow.space;
  return 301 https://packer.baythium.com$request_uri;
}

# Configure a virtual host (packer.baythium.com)
server {
  # Listen to port 80 with the server_name as localhost and packer.baythium.com
  # NOTE: It is important to keep the port as 80 for a public-facing website, or else the end user will have to type the port explicitly in the URL
  listen 10033;

  # listen 443 ssl;
  # listen [::]:443 ssl;

  # NOTE: Every request you make from the server is logged to a file so that you can analyze it later

  # NOTE: The logging levels HAVE TO be defined in increasing order
  # WARNING: The logging level <info> IS NOT recommended in production since the logs may become massive if your website is hit very frequently.
  # NOTE: The logs should be periodically analyzed to verify if it contains anything alarming.
  # NOTE: You SHOULD always set the log level to either warn or error.
