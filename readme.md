## How to use

### Bash

First and foremost, you have to install required dependencies which are part of the entire program. Just use subsequent commands in sequence:

```bash
# Get info on an updated version of packages or their dependencies
sudo apt update

# Install zip/unzip utilities
sudo apt install zip unzip

# Install lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor
sudo apt install jq
```

For instance, the jq is used for processing configuration data along with a basic structure composed of sections, properties, and values. Whereas the zip/unzip utilities are used for working with archives.

### Powershell
