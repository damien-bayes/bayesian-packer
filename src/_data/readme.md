# Data Folder

The _data directory (Global Data Files Directory) is where you can store data files whose data will be passed on
to all of our template and layout files.

All .json and module.exports values from .js files inside of the _data directory will be added into a global
data object.

The global data object includes default global data and will also contain any data you include as .js or .json
files in the _data directory.

This global data object is available to all templates and layout files by default.
